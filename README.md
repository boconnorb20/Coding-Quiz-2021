# Coding-Quiz-2021

This Project was for sure difficult

All good intentions with the project. Had some problems just filling in some of the coding gaps. 

Areas needed to complete were:
- scoring
- linking "correct answer" to button clicked
- highscores
- CSS
- few timer glitches

These all to name a few. It was a good learning experiance and I will most likely be coming back to this in te near future.
